# Chat with MySQL

This is a Streamlit application that allows users to interact with a MySQL database via natural language queries. The app uses LangChain, Groq, and Streamlit to generate SQL queries and respond with database results in natural language.

## Features
- Connect to your MySQL database and chat with it using natural language.
- Automatically generate SQL queries based on your questions.
- Receive responses both in SQL and human-readable formats.

## Libraries and Tools Used
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **LangChain**: Handles the prompt templates and chains for generating SQL queries and responses.
- **Groq**: Utilized as the model for chat-based interactions and SQL generation.
- **Streamlit**: Provides the interface for interacting with the database and handling the conversation.
- **SQLDatabase**: LangChain's utility to manage SQL database connections and queries.
  
## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/chat-with-mysql.git
   cd chat-with-mysql
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your database credentials:

bash
Copy code
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=admin
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=Chinook
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open your browser and go to the Streamlit web app, typically at http://localhost:8501.

How It Works
The app connects to a MySQL database using credentials from environment variables.
It uses a LangChain model to process user queries, convert them into SQL statements, and return the results.
You can view the SQL query generated from your questions and the corresponding response.
